Spell Checker ( C language)
The use of trie data structure gives an efficient way of searching for a string.
The string with O(n) size and a substring with O(m) size takes O(n) minimum time to be searched,and takes least amount of memory.
This algorithm searches the substring in O(m) time which is independent of the source string.
TIME= O(|m|)!
The program has successfully loaded a dictionary onto a trie.
